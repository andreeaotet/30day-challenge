                    JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
                    is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
                    example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
                    its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date,
                    and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control
                    structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a
                    variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for
                    example:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
                        to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example,
                        client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an
                        HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input,
                        and page navigation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
                        relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side
                        extensions allow an application to communicate with a database,
                        provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of
                        the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
                    </li>

                <p>
                    There are majorly two types of languages. First, one is Statically typed language where each
                    variable and expression type is already known at compile time. Once a variable is declared to be of
                    a certain data type, it cannot hold values of other data types.Example: C, C++, Java.
                </p>
                <code>
                        // Java(Statically typed) 
                        int x = 5 // variable x is of type int and it will not store any other type. 
                        string y = 'abc' // type string and will only accept string values 
                </code>
                <p>
                    Other, Dynamically typed languages: These languages can receive different data types over time. For
                    example- Ruby, Python, JavaScript etc.
                </p>
                <code>
                        // Javascript(Dynamically typed) 
                        var x = 5; // can store an integer 
                        var name = 'string'; // can also store a string.                         
                </code>
                <p>
                    The latest ECMAScript(ES6) standard defines seven data types: Out of which six data types are
                    Primitive(predefined).
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Numbers: 5, 6.5, 7 etc.</li>
                    <li>String: “Hello World"</li>
                    <li>Boolean: Represent a logical entity and can have two values: true or false</li>
                    <li>Null: This type has only one value : null.</li>
                    <li>Undefined: A variable that has not been assigned a value is undefined.</li>
                    <li>Object: It is the most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Variables in JavaScript are containers which hold reusable data. It is the basic unit of storage in
                    a program.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The value stored in a variable can be changed during program execution</li>
                    <li>A variable is only a name given to a memory location, all the operations done on the variable
                        effects that memory location</li>
                    <li>In JavaScript, all the variables must be declared before they can be used</li>
                </ul>
                <code>
                        var var_name;
                        var x;
                </code>

        <section class="main-section" id="Scope">
            <header>Understanding variable scopes in Javascript</header>
            <article>
                <p>
                    In JavaScript, there are two types of scopes:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Global Scope – Scope outside the outermost function attached to window</li>
                    <li>Local Scope – Inside the function being executed</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Let’s look at the code below. We have a global variable defined in first line in global scope. Then
                    we have a local variable defined inside the function fun().
                </p>
                <code>
                        let globalLet = "This is a global variable"; 

                        function fun() { 
                        let localLet = "This is a local variable"; 
                        
                        console.log(globalLet); // This is a global variable 
                        console.log(localLet); // This is a local variable 
                        } 
                        fun(); 
                </code>
            </article>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Functions">

            <article>
                <p>
                    A function is a set of statements that take inputs, do some specific computation and produces
                    output. Basically, a function is a set of statements that performs some tasks or does some
                    computation and then returns the result to the user.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done task together and make a function so that
                    instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs, we can call that function
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can create functions in JavaScript using the keyword function. The basic syntax to create a
                    function in JavaScript is shown below.
                </p>
                <code>
                        function functionName(Parameter1, Parameter2, ..)
                        {
                            // Function body
                        }
                </code>
                <p>
                    To create a function in JavaScript, we have to first use the keyword function, separated by name of
                    function and parameters within parenthesis. The part of function inside the curly braces {} is the
                    body of the function.

            <article>
                <p>
                    Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern
                    JavaScript. These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types(Number, String,
                    Boolean, null, undefined and symbol) in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a
                    single value each (depending on their types).
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive
                        data-types as well as reference data-types
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        An object, is a reference data type. Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a
                        reference or a pointer to that value. That reference or pointer points to the location in memory
                        where the object is stored. The variables don’t actually store the value
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Loosely speaking, objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related
                        data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs. These keys can be
                        variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an
                        object.
                    </li>

                    Decision Making in programming is similar to decision making in real life. In programming also we
                    face some situations where we want a certain block of code to be executed when some condition is
                    fulfilled.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A programming language uses control statements to control the flow of execution of the program based
                    on certain conditions. These are used to cause the flow of execution to advance and branch based on
                    changes to the state of a program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    if-else: The if statement alone tells us that if a condition is true it will execute a block of
                    statements and if the condition is false it won’t. But what if we want to do something else if the
                    condition is false. Here comes the else statement. We can use the else statement with if statement
                    to execute a block of code when the condition is false.
                </p>
                <code>
                        if (condition)
                        {
                            // Executes this block if
                            // condition is true
                        }
                        else
                        {
                            // Executes this block if
                            // condition is false
                        }
                </code>

            <article>
                <p>
                    The switch case statement in JavaScript is also used for decision making purposes. In some cases,
                    using the switch case statement is seen to be more convenient over if-else statements. Consider a
                    situation when we want to test a variable for hundred different values and based on the test we want
                    to execute some task. Using if-else statement for this purpose will be less efficient over switch
                    case statements and also it will make the code look messy
                </p>
                <p>
                    The switch case statement is a multiway branch statement. It provides an easy way to dispatch
                    execution to different parts of code based on the value of the expression.
                </p>
                <code>
                        switch (expression)
                        {
                            case value1:
                                statement1;
                                break;
                            case value2:

                            .
                            .

                <p>
                    Looping in programming languages is a feature which facilitates the execution of a set of
                    instructions/functions repeatedly while some condition evaluates to true. For example, suppose we
                    want to print “Hello World” 10 times.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Loop, the statement needs to be written only once and the loop will be executed 10 times as shown
                    below:

                    JavaScript modules are the best implementation of Closure. Modules are small units of independent,
                    reusable code that is desired to be used as the building blocks in creating a non-trivial Javascript
                    application. Modules let the developer define private and public members separately, making it one
                    of the more desired design patterns in JavaScript paradigm. You may see modules as Classes as in any
                    other Object Oriented Programming Language.

                    JavaScript is loosely typed language and most of the time operators automatically convert a value to
                    the right type but there are also cases when we need to explicitly do type conversions.
                    While JavaScript provides numerous ways to convert data from one type to another but there are two
                    most common data conversions :
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Converting Values to String</li>
                    <li>Converting Values to Numbers</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    String() or toString() function can be used in JavaScript to convert a value to a string.
                    <br>Syntax of String() function:
                </p>
                <code>
                    String(value)

                    <b> Example:</b>
                    
                    Input:
                    var v = 1555;
                    var s = String(v);
                    Output:
                    now s contains "1555".
                </code>
                <p>
                    We can use Number() function in JavaScript to convert a value to a Number. It can convert any
                    numerical text and boolean value to a Number. In case of strings of non-numbers it will convert it
                    to a NaN(Not a Number).
                </p>
                <code>
                    Number(valueToConvert)

                    <b>Example:</b>

                    Input:
                    var s = "144";
                    var n = Number(s);
                    Output:
                    now n contain 144(Number).

            <article>
                <p>
                    In JavaScript, Hoisting is the default behavior of moving all the declarations at the top of the
                    scope before code execution. Basically, it gives us an advantage that no matter where functions and
                    variables are declared, they are moved to the top of their scope regardless of whether their scope
                    is global or local.
                    It allows us to call functions before even writing them in our code.
                    <br>
                    <b>Note:</b> JavaScript only hoists declarations, not the initialisations.

                <p>
                    In JavaScript, ‘this’ identifier can be used in different contexts and scopes. Let us go through
                    each to determine what this is and how it is decided.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whenever ‘this’ keyword is used in the global context i.e. not as a member of function or object
                    declaration, it always refers to the Global object. The following example will illustrate this
                    behavior.
                </p>
                <code>
                    // Declaring variable in global context. 
                    var a = "GFG"; 
                    console.log(a); 

                    // Using this we refer to the Global Context. 
                    // And update the value of a we declared previously. 
                    this.a = "GeeksforGeeks"; 
                    console.log(a); 
                </code>
                <p>
                    If a function has a ‘this’ reference inside it, it can be said that the this refers to an object,
                    not the function itself( which is generally the most common mistake programmers make ).
                    To determine which object the ‘this’ points to depends on how the function was called in the first
                    place. The following example will put some light on the case.
                </p>
                <code>
                    // Function that contains this. 
                    function myFunc() { 
                    console.log( this.a ); 
                    } 

                    var a = "Global"; 

                    // Owner of the function. 
                    var myObj1 = { 
                    a: "myObj1", 
                    myFunc: myFunc 
                    }; 

                    // Object other than the owner. 
                    var myObj2 = { 
                    a: "myObj2"
                    }; 

                    // Call the function in Global Scope. 
                    myFunc(); 

                    // Call the function from the reference of owner. 
                    myObj1.myFunc(); 

                    // Call the function from the reference 
                    // of object other than the owner. 
                    myFunc.call( myObj2 ); 

                    // Create a new undefined object. 
                    new myFunc();
                </code>
                <p>
                    ‘this’ inside of an event handler always refers to the element it was triggered on. Let us see an
                    example to illustrate the same.
                </p>
                <code>
                    <div id="clickMe">Welcome to GFG!</div> 
                    function clickedMe() { 
                        console.log(this.innerHTML); 
                    } 

                    clickedMe(); // undefined because global object. 

                    var myElem = document.getElementById('clickMe'); 
                    myElem.onclick = clickedMe; 

                    myElem.onclick(); // Welcome to GFG!

        <section class="main-section" id="Strict">
            <header>Strict Mode in JavaScript</header>
            <article>
                <p>
                    Strict Mode is a new feature in ECMAScript 5 that allows you to place a program, or a function, in a
                    “strict” operating context. This strict context prevents certain actions from being taken and throws
                    more exceptions. The statement “use strict”; instructs the browser to use the Strict mode, which is
                    a reduced and safer feature set of JavaScript.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To invoke strict mode for an entire script, put the exact statement “use strict”; (or ‘use strict’;)
                    before any other statements.
                </p>
                <code>
                    // Whole-script strict mode syntax
                    'use strict';
                    let v = "strict mode script!";

        <section class="main-section" id="Callbacks">
            <header>Callbacks</header>
            <article>
                <p>
                    Callbacks are a great way to handle something after something else has been completed. By something
                    here we mean a function execution. If we want to execute a function right after the return of some
                    other function, then callbacks can be used.

                    JavaScript functions have the type of Objects. So, much like any other objects (String, Arrays
                    etc.), They can be passed as an argument to any other function while calling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Callbacks are primarily used while handling asynchronous operations like – making an API request to
                    the Google Maps, fetching/writing some data from/into a file, registering event listeners and
                    related stuff. All the operations mentioned uses callbacks. This way once the data/error from the
                    asynchronous operation is returned, the callbacks are used to do something with that inside our
                    code.
